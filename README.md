# AAI510_ML_Final_Project | Credit Card Fraud Detection

Overview

In recent years, credit card fraud has become increasingly prevalent, affecting 65% of cardholders at least once according to a 2023 study by security.org. Frauds can manifest through various methods such as skimming, identity theft, phishing, and unauthorized online transactions. Concurrently, the surge in online shopping and the adoption of modern payment technologies like auto-pay and contactless payments have amplified the reliance on credit cards over cash. This project leverages machine learning to analyze and interpret data on fraudulent transactions, aiming to enhance the security of credit card usage.
Project Objectives

The primary goals of this research are:

* Data Analysis and Preprocessing: To process and analyze real-world transaction data for modeling.
* Fraud Detection with Machine Learning: To employ machine learning techniques to detect and categorize fraudulent transactions accurately.
* Algorithm Evaluation: To assess the effectiveness of various machine learning models using metrics such as accuracy.
* Model Comparison: To explore and document the capabilities and limitations of different algorithms in fraud detection.

Key Findings

Our research focuses on identifying the characteristics of fraudulent transactions and developing predictive models to detect such activities. We tested multiple algorithms, including Linear Regression, Naive Bayes, k-Nearest Neighbors, Decision Trees, and Logistic Regression. The Decision Tree model proved to be the most effective, achieving an accuracy of 96.75%, closely followed by the Logistic Regression model at 93.53%.
Conclusion

This project aims to utilize machine learning algorithms to effectively identify and classify fraudulent transactions in credit or debit card data. Our findings highlight the potential of machine learning in improving financial security and fostering trust in electronic transactions. Through the implementation of robust detection systems, we anticipate a significant reduction in the incidence of credit card fraud.
